<body>
  Hello, on this website I will tell you all about rabbits! I myself, have to rabbits;Dumbeldore, and Pumpkin. First off, I will 
  talk about the foods rabbits can eat. My rabbits, are very picky. But, they do LOVE celery, and carrots. And, no it is not just 
  a myth that rabbits eat carrots. Rabbits always should eat pellets. They have protien, and are very delicous. If you would like
  recipies for rabbit treats, then go to --------------------------. If you go to the pet-store for treats/toys for your rabbit or 
  rabbits, then I suggest apple sticks, and rice pops. If you look at some treats, under no sircumstances get the yogurt bites. 
  Yogurt, although humans can have it, it is very poisinous to rabbits.
